# [jschilders.dev](https://jschilders.dev)

My personal portfolio repository.
Whenever deployed to this repository, a web hook from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will get fired.
This builds the project on one of their servers and returns a couple of URL's, for previewing, etc.
The master branch is in sync with my own domains.

## Usage

Start by installing npm packages.

`npm install`

To run locally:

`npm run dev`

Manually building the application

`npm run build`

Testing the manually built application

`npm run start`
